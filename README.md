## Development

### Setup

Create a file `app/kickr.development.yml` based on the provided sample configuration.

You will need MySQL / MariaDB to resemble the official development setup. Set it up and add it to the configuration.

Install the required client dependencies via

```
(cd client && bower install && npm install)
```

### Migrate Database

You can use the `db migrate` task provided by the kickr application itself to upgrade your database schema to the latest version.

```
(cd app && mvn package && java -jar target/backend-0.0.1.jar db migrate kickr.development.yml)
```

### Run

Run the backend:

```
(cd app && mvn clean compile exec:java)
```

Add the client:

```
(cd client && grunt auto-build)
```
