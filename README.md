## Features

* Log table soccer games (up to 2 vs. 2 players)
* Generate statistics


## Technology Stack

This application uses [dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/) as a technology stack for the back-end. It builds on top of Hibernate for object relational mapping and Jersey for the REST api.

The front-end stack consists of an AngularJS application that is being bundled for the browser using browserify. It uses less for CSS processing.
